Assignment 1

1. Explain JDK, JRE and JVM?
-->  JDK: 
		JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit to develop applications in Java.
		In addition to JRE, JDK also contains number of development tools (compilers, JavaDoc, Java Debugger etc.).

	 JRE:
		JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the implementation of JVM and is defined as a software package
		that provides Java class libraries,
		along with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
		and other components to run applications written in Java programming.
		
	 JVM:
		JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that is platform-dependent and
		has three notions as a specification, a document that describes requirement of JVM implementation,
		implementation, a computer program that meets JVM requirements,
		and instance, an implementation that executes Java byte code
		provides a runtime environment for executing Java byte code.
		
		
2. Why Java is platform independent
-->  Java is platform-independent because it uses a virtual machine.
	The Java programming language and all APIs are compiled into bytecodes.
	Bytecodes are effectively platform-independent.
	The virtual machine takes care of the differences between the bytecodes for the different platforms
	
3. List down all primitive data types in java in order of their capacity.
-->byte=8 bits
	char=16bits
	short=16bits
	int=32bits
	long=64bits
	float=32bits
	double=64bits
	boolean=true/false
	
4. Which of the following are valid variable names?
--> b)my$Var

11. State true or false. Rewrite statement correctly if false.

a)Java program compiles and interprets each time you execute it.
-->true: Java is considered as both interpreted and compiled. It uses a Java compiler (javac)
 and JVM ( which is actually a software-based interpreter)
 to execute a Java

b) Java is platform independent but JVM is not.
-->false: Java is platform-independent but JVM is platform dependent
